## Installation

It is recommended to install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com) through the `npm` package manager, which comes bundled with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) when you install it on your system. It is recommended to use a Node.js version `>= 16.0.0`.

Once you have `npm` installed, you can run the following both to install and upgrade Yarn:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

After having installed Yarn, simply run:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Running Deployments 

```bash
yarn xdeploy
```

This template uses the [xdeploy](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/xdeployer) Hardhat plugin. Check out the documentation for more information on the specifics of the deployments.

## `.env` File 

In the `.env` file place the private key of your wallet in the `PRIVATE_KEY` section. This allows secure access to your wallet to use with both testnet and mainnet funds during Hardhat deployments. For more information on how this works, please read the documentation of the `npm` package [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

## Verification

Change the contract address to your contract after the deployment has been successful. This works for both testnet and mainnet. You will need to get an API key from [etherscan](https://etherscan.io), [snowtrace](https://snowtrace.io) etc.

Typescript deployment example:
npx hardhat verify --network fantomMain YOUR_CONTRACT_HERE --constructor-args deploy-arg.ts 

npx hardhat verify --network bscTestnet YOUR_CONTRACT_HERE --constructor-args arguments.js
